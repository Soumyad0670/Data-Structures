## 🔍 What's Inside?

### 🔗 Linked Lists
- `singly_linked_list.py` → Basic node manipulation, insert/delete operations
- `doubly_linked_list.py` → Forward and backward traversal
- `circular_linked_list.py` → Circular navigation of nodes

### 🌲 Trees
- `binary_tree.py` → Simple binary tree with traversal methods
- `binary_search_tree.py` → BST operations: insert, search, delete
- `AVL_tree.py` → Self-balancing BST with rotations

### 📦 Stacks and Queues
- `stack.py` → Stack using list (LIFO)
- `queue.py` → Linear queue
- `deque.py` → Double-ended queue

### 🌐 Graphs
- `adjacency_list.py` → Graph representation
- `dfs_bfs.py` → Depth and Breadth First Traversal
- `dijkstra.py` → Shortest path algorithm

### 🔐 Hashing
- `hashmap.py` → Basic hash table with collision handling

### 🔃 Sorting
- `bubble_sort.py` → Brute-force sorting
- `merge_sort.py` → Divide and conquer approach
- `quick_sort.py` → Pivot-based efficient sorting

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Soumyad0670/Data-Structure.git
   cd Data-Structure

Run an Example

cd Trees
python binary_search_tree.py

💡 No external libraries required — just pure Python!

🧠 Learning Goals
Understand how fundamental data structures work under the hood

Know how to implement them without using Python’s built-in types

Strengthen problem-solving for coding interviews

🛠️ Features
✅ Python 3.x compatible

✅ Beginner-friendly code

✅ Each script is standalone & testable

✅ Great for practicing DSA for interviews
